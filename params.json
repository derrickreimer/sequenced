{"name":"Sequenced","body":"Sequenced is a simple Rails 3 plugin that generates scoped sequential IDs for \r\nActiveRecord models. This gem provides an `acts_as_sequenced` macro that \r\nautomatically assigns a unique, sequential ID to each record. This ID is \r\nnot a replacement for the database primary key, but rather adds another way to \r\nretrieve the object without exposing the primary key.\r\n\r\nExtracted from the [GuideKit](https://guidekit.com) codebase.\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nIt's generally a bad practice to expose your primary keys to the world \r\nin your URLs. However, it is often appropriate to number objects in sequence \r\n(in the context of a parent object).\r\n\r\nFor example, given a Question model that has many Answers, it makes sense\r\nto number answers sequentially for each individual question. You can achieve \r\nthis with Sequenced in one line of code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Question < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :answers\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Answer < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :question\r\n  acts_as_sequenced :scope => :question_id\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile:\r\n   \r\n    gem 'sequenced'\r\n\r\nInstall the gem with bundler:\r\n\r\n    bundle install\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo add a sequential ID to a model, first add an integer column called\r\n`sequential_id` to the model (or you many name the column anything you\r\nlike and override the default). For example:\r\n\r\n    rails generate migration add_sequential_id_to_answers sequential_id:integer\r\n    rake db:migrate\r\n\r\nThen, call the `acts_as_sequenced` macro in your model class:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Answer < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :question\r\n  acts_as_sequenced :scope => :question_id\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `:scope` option can be any attribute, but will typically be the foreign\r\nkey of an associated parent object.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### Overriding the default sequential ID column\r\n\r\nBy default, Sequenced uses the `sequential_id` column and assumes it already \r\nexists. If you wish to store the sequential ID in different integer column, \r\nsimply specify the column name with the `:column` option:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nacts_as_sequenced :scope => :question_id, :column => :my_sequential_id\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Starting the sequence at a specific number\r\n\r\nBy default, Sequenced begins sequences with 1. To start at a different \r\ninteger, simply set the `:start_at` option:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nacts_as_sequenced :scope => :question_id, :start_at => 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Indexing the sequential ID column\r\n\r\nFor optimal performance, it's a good idea to index the sequential ID column\r\non sequenced models.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a question model that has many answers. This example \r\ndemonstrates how to use Sequenced to enable access to the nested answer\r\nresource via its sequential ID.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# app/models/question.rb\r\nclass Question < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :answers\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/models/answer.rb\r\nclass Answer < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :question\r\n  acts_as_sequenced :scope => :question_id\r\n  \r\n  # Automatically use the sequential ID in URLs\r\n  def to_param\r\n    self.sequential_id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# config/routes.rb\r\nresources :questions\r\n  resources :answers\r\nend\r\n\r\n# app/controllers/answers_controller.rb\r\nclass AnswersController < ApplicationController\r\n  before_filter :load_question\r\n  before_filter :load_answer, :only => [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]\r\n  \r\nprivate\r\n\r\n  def load_question\r\n    @question = Question.find(params[:question_id])\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  def load_answer\r\n    @answer = @question.answers.where(:sequential_id => params[:id]).first\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, answers are accessible via their sequential IDs:\r\n\r\n    http://example.com/questions/5/answers/1    # Good\r\n\r\ninstead of by their primary keys:\r\n\r\n    http://example.com/questions/5/answer/32454  # Bad\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright &copy; 2012 Derrick Reimer\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
