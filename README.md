# Sequenced

Sequenced is a simple gem that generates scoped sequential IDs for 
ActiveRecord models. This gem provides an `acts_as_sequenced` macro that 
automatically assigns a unique, sequential ID to each record. The sequential ID is 
not a replacement for the database primary key, but rather adds another way to 
retrieve the object without exposing the primary key.

## Purpose

It's generally a bad practice to expose your primary keys to the world 
in your URLs. However, it is often appropriate to number objects in sequence 
(in the context of a parent object).

For example, given a Question model that has many Answers, it makes sense
to number answers sequentially for each individual question. You can achieve 
this with Sequenced in one line of code:

```ruby
class Question < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :answers
end

class Answer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :question
  acts_as_sequenced scope: :question_id
end
```

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile:
   
    gem 'sequenced'

Install the gem with bundler:

    bundle install

## Usage

To add a sequential ID to a model, first add an integer column called
`sequential_id` to the model (or you many name the column anything you
like and override the default). For example:

    rails generate migration add_sequential_id_to_answers sequential_id:integer
    rake db:migrate

Then, call the `acts_as_sequenced` macro in your model class:

```ruby
class Answer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :question
  acts_as_sequenced scope: :question_id
end
```

The `scope` option can be any attribute, but will typically be the foreign
key of an associated parent object. You can even scope by multiple columns
for polymorphic relationships:

```ruby
class Answer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :questionable, :polymorphic => true
  acts_as_sequenced scope: [:questionable_id, :questionable_type]
end
```

## Configuration

### Overriding the default sequential ID column

By default, Sequenced uses the `sequential_id` column and assumes it already 
exists. If you wish to store the sequential ID in different integer column, 
simply specify the column name with the `column` option:

```ruby
acts_as_sequenced scope: :question_id, column: :my_sequential_id
```

### Starting the sequence at a specific number

By default, Sequenced begins sequences with 1. To start at a different 
integer, simply set the `start_at` option:

```ruby
acts_as_sequenced start_at: 1000
```

You may also pass a lambda to the `start_at` option:

```ruby
acts_as_sequenced skip: lambda { |r| r.computed_start_value }
```

### Indexing the sequential ID column

For optimal performance, it's a good idea to index the sequential ID column
on sequenced models.

### Skipping sequential ID generation

If you'd like to skip generating a sequential ID under certain conditions,
you may pass a lambda to the `skip` option:

```ruby
acts_as_sequenced skip: lambda { |r| r.score == 0 }
```

## Example

Suppose you have a question model that has many answers. This example 
demonstrates how to use Sequenced to enable access to the nested answer
resource via its sequential ID.

```ruby
# app/models/question.rb
class Question < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :answers
end

# app/models/answer.rb
class Answer < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :question
  acts_as_sequenced scope: :question_id
  
  # Automatically use the sequential ID in URLs
  def to_param
    self.sequential_id
  end
end

# config/routes.rb
resources :questions
  resources :answers
end

# app/controllers/answers_controller.rb
class AnswersController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :load_question
  before_filter :load_answer, only: [:show, :edit, :update, :destroy]
  
private

  def load_question
    @question = Question.find(params[:question_id])
  end
  
  def load_answer
    @answer = @question.answers.where(:sequential_id => params[:id]).first
  end
end
```

Now, answers are accessible via their sequential IDs:

    http://example.com/questions/5/answers/1    # Good

instead of by their primary keys:

    http://example.com/questions/5/answer/32454  # Bad
